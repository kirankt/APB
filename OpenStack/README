To test the APBs using ansible-playbook command:

e.g.
ansible-playbook --verbose ~/APB/OpenStack/keystone-apb/playbooks/provision.yml -e "namespace=osp-dev"

Broken:
Need to fix the image link to the local docker registry on the APBs. Only needed if you're using local registry.
Will work if you're using a public registry.
